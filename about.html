<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a pretty simple person so there's not much to tell.</p>

<p>I graduated high school in 2016, I've been working retail ever since and it was getting old.
I started looking into jobs that could be done remotely and, in my research, discovered coding. I had never been terribly computer savvy,
but I thought,"Why not?" I decided to purchase a twenty-dollar coding course on Udemy just to see what it's like to make a website and, to my surprise,
I found it quite easy to understand.</p>
